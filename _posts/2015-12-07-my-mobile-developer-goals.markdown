title: My mobile developer goals

The first of my mobile developer goals is to become more proficient in iOS app development. I have learned a lot at Bloc but I have a lot more to learn. I've been a software engineer for over 10 years and I've had the opportunity to play a major role in many different kinds of applications. This is my first time being exposed to building mobile applications. It's a much different experience. Once I learned Objective-C the next thing was learning the best practices in building and testing mobile applications. I find that learning the best practices helps avoid many pitfalls and allows me to stand on the shoulders of those who have much more experience than me.

I'd like to begin a career as an iOS software engineer. I believe that I can apply everything that I've learned at Bloc along with my years of experience in software to have a successful career. I love new challenges and I really enjoy writing code.

My next goal is develop an app and get it accepted into the App Store. I have an idea on an app that I will work on next. I will apply everything that I've learned and take it further to see my own idea to fruition. I will then try to make the app better and better as I learn from user feedback.
